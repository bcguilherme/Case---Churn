# Case---Churn

# Churn Prediction Models and Hyperparameter Tuning

This repository contains a Python code example that demonstrates how to train classification models for predicting customer churn based on customer data. The models include Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Additionally, the code includes an example of hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, xgboost

Make sure you have the required libraries installed in your environment before running the code.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

2. https://github.com/bcguilherme/churn-prediction-models.git


3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in your preferred environment. Ensure that the data file `churn_data.xlsx` is in the same directory.

4. The code will load the data, prepare the models, and calculate evaluation metrics for Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

5. You can adjust the models' hyperparameters in the code to optimize performance.

## Repository Structure

- `churn_data.xlsx`: The example data file.
- `churn_model.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook file with the complete code.
- `churn_model.py`: A Python file with the same code.
